# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition

A machine learning project to classify human emotions from speech audio using signal processing and deep learning techniques.

## 📌 Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) aims to identify the emotional state of a speaker from their voice. This project uses audio feature extraction (MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Contrast) and a neural network classifier to detect emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **neutral**, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing and feature extraction from `.wav` files
- Emotion classification using deep learning (CNN/LSTM)
- Support for multiple datasets (e.g., RAVDESS,
